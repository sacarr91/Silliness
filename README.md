# In the Market Blog Site

## Deployed Site
<https://sacarr91.github.io/marketing-blog/>

## Description
Marketing students on a local device can share their thoughts and wonderings on a community-focused blog page, and read posts their colleagues have shared.

As this site only stores to and pulls from local storage, you don't have to worry about your safe-space wonderings being evaluated by anyone outside the learning environment! Local storage functionality also allows for time to elapse between posts--letting students come and go as they might, leaving and reading posts like they would on a dorm hall bulletin board.

## Features
[x] Dark/Light mode toggle
[x] Land on "Write" page upon site load for quick access when inspiration strikes
[x] Auto-redirect to "Read" page after posting
[x] Blog posts displayed in attractive cards for easy perusal of multiple posts at-a-glance
[x] Scroll functionality on cards for the more loquacious blog entries
